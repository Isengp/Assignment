The district consists of five taluks: Thodupuzha, Devikulam, Idukki, Udumbanchola, and Peerumedu. Anamudi and Meesapulimala, the two highest peaks in India south of the Himalayas, are located in Idukki district.</p>

The dam, built across the river, and located between two hills is one of its kind in Asia and world’s second. Legend has it that these two hills were actually two tribals, Kuravan and Kurathy who were cursed by Lord Rama when they were caught watching Devi Sita bathing in the river. </p>

            <p class="card-text">The scenic waterfalls near Thodupuzha have a dark past. People say there was once a tribal named Thomman who fell into the waterfall, hence the name. The most curious thing about the waterfall is that it is a seven-step waterfall. Adventure tourism is allowed here. Forest trekking and bathing are other activities.</p>
