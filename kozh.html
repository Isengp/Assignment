    <h3>Kozhikode</h3>
    <p>Kozhikode District or Calicut district is a district of Kerala state, on the southwest coast of India. Kozhikode district is bordered by the districts of Kannur and Mahé (Puducherry) to the north, Wayanad to the east, and Malappuram to the south. The Arabian Sea lies to the west and Western Ghats stretches towards east. Vavul Mala is the highest peak in the district. In 2001 the district was divided into four taluks: Kozhikode, Vatakara, Koyilandy and Thamarassery. </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Beypore</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Located 10 km from Calicut, is this ship-building port of Beypore.  It is also one of  of the busiest fishing harbors in Kerala. It was known as such centuries ago. The skilled workmen use the best of wood and build huge “Uru” for those who place orders. Even the rivets used are wooden. Their clientele  were the Arabs who sailed a lot for trade. Such Urus used to be unloaded at the Calicut port using Cranes. We can see the making of an Uru and also the finished product.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Mananchira Square</h5>
            <p class="card-text">This forms the heart of the city. The name comes from the large pool of clear water bound by laterite stone steps built by Manavedan Raja  one of the earlier Zamorins. The park around it is tastefully kept with  types of palms, trees and shrubs. Recently there is a move to adorn the city with sculptures and a number of them has come up here. There is an open air theater and a musical fountain. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Definitely a beautiful beach about 20 km from Calicut. Its historical importance stems from the fact that  Vasco da Gama with his sailors landed here in 1498 in 3 ships.  This was the start of economic relationship between Europeans and this part of India now called Kerala.</p>
