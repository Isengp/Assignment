    <h3>Malappuram</h3>
    <p>It is the most populous district in Kerala. Today it is the third-largest district in Kerala in terms of area. Malappuram district was carved out by combining some portions of the former Palakkad and Kozhikode districts- Eranad taluk and portions of Tirur taluk in the former Kozhikode district, and portions of Perinthalmanna taluk and Ponnani taluk in the former Palakkad district. The district has a rich cultural and political heritage. The port of Ponnani (known as Tyndis in the ancient period) was a centre of trade with Ancient Rome. During Sangam period, the region was included in the Kudanadu, a province in the Ancient Tamilakam.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In the island of Bolgatty lies Kochi’s famous Bolgatty Palace. It is one of the oldest existing Dutch palaces in the world. It was built by the Dutch traders in the year 1744 and later was extended and gardens were landscaped around it. This was at that time the Governor’s palace for the commander of the Dutch Malabar. In the year 1909 it was leased out to the British, hence serving as the home of the British Governors. It was also the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj. </p>
