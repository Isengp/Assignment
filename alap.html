    <h3>Alappuzha</h3>
    <p>Alappuzha is the smallest district in Kerala. It was formed as Alleppey District on 17 August 1957. The name of the district was officially changed to Alappuzha in 1990.[4] Alleppey town was renamed Alappuzha in 2012, even though the anglicised name is still commonly used to describe the town as well as the district. Alappuzha is well connected by waterways to various other parts of Kerala, including the tourist destination of Kumarakom; and the district is itself a well known tourist destination. The district is known for its Coir factories, as most of Kerala's coir industries are situated in and around Alappuzha. </p>
